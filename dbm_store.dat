I didn't get this for gaming. I needed a backlit keyboard to replace an ancient one and this one has some features similar to the old one. The wide wrist rest for one thing. It's not a slim keyboard like the junky ones you get with your new computer. If it were a boat, I'd call it beamy.  What I like: It lights up. Pick a color or do what I'm trying and just leaving it at all colors. My eyes feel less strained using the mix. It's quiet without being mushy. The keys feel like and old typewriter if anyone out there is old enough to recall those. It makes for very easy typing. That it's not wireless. I like a wireless mouse, but a wireless keyboard is not worth it to me since I'm not actually dragging the wire around like I would with a mouse. Nothing to eat more batteries.  What I don't like: The back row of keys do not light up. Not that I have much use for any of them, but it seems weird that they made it so they cannot be seen in the dark.  So far, the likes outweigh the don't likes.  The mouse. No clue on that. I won't be using it. I looked at it and it seems to have a lot of buttons to play with, but it would not replace my wireless small mouse that just fits my hand.  I would recommend this if you're looking for a decent backlit keyboard. I do have it on a sliding keyboard tray with the back props up and it still has room to slide away. The measurements were not given in the specs so I wasn't sure it would work, but it does.///The Redragon S101 Wired Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo is an affordable and high-performance gaming accessory set that comes with a RGB backlit gaming keyboard and a gaming mouse.

Buttons are quiet , soft feeling. and the color schemes are really nice. I haven't used the mouse yet, but the weight felt just right on it and the size fits my hands good.  I definitely recommend this keyboard/mouse set///Love this keyboard. Bought it for my son when he was around 12 and he thought it was pretty awesome. The lights really make it look great. Recently bought it for my 10 year old nephew who upon installation, leaned over and whispered...I love you keyboard!!! Can't beat that review, lol.///This is a top-of-the-line keyboard and gaming mouse from a specialist company, I was shocked to see it at this price. It types very smooth and clear, the type noise isn't loud yet still has that comforting sound. The controls for the colors, patterns etc are incredible, lots of variety and mixes. The mouse is also great, feels just right and feels very smooth in games, also very comfortable for long office hours, same for the keyboard. Must buy in my opinion, this is a rare bargain.///I bought this for working from home love that I can change the lights. I sit in a kinda dark office because of migraines and the keyboard is just bright enough to ser///Bought for entry level gaming for my son. Overall the quality/comfort is good for the price. Keyboard LEDs are preset colors and can't be customized. Great starter keyboard and mouse.///I have been very satisfied with my purchase. Looks good with my set up///Product is awesome. Works fantastically. No issues at all, and functions as it's supposed to. My only complaint is how it was shipped. It was sent via USPS and not through Amazon itself, which caused a lot of problems. First, the package was way too big to fit inside a mailbox (obviously) but it also could not fit inside a parcel mailbox either, and I was forced to retrieve it from the post office. Items like this are better sent via Amazon's own delivery service, or Fedex, etc. USPS is not designed to deliver large packages. Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.///Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the "you get what you pay for" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.  The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange "tall" type that relocates the "\" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.  Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. "#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... "What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.  TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice.@@@3]]]7]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]34                                          Man, I thought I'd found the perfect earbuds and am so bummed I have to return these. A little background: I've been using v1 of the Airpods Pro for about 2.5 years. One of them flaked out last week so I began searching for a replacement. While I'm well within the Apple universe (MacBook Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, iPad Pro, etc) I also use Windows quite a bit. In my search I read dozens of reviews on earbuds, and the vast majority of them almost presumptively point Apple users to the Airpods Pro 2. I get it, in theory everything syncs up and works better. But there were things I didn't like about the Airpods Pro 1 (ANC was mediocre, and particularly bad on a plane; sound quality was meh). So I was actually eager to step outside the Apple box and try something a little more universal. I narrowed my search down to two, and ended up purchasing both the Bose QC II as well as the Airpods Pro 2, with the intent of doing my own use case testing and returning one.  Upon receiving and trying both, it took me less than 30 minutes to decide which to keep: The Bose QC II. The ANC on the Airpods 2 was very, very good, but the Bose QC II just took it a couple notches better. As I travel on airplanes quite a bit the ANC was very important to me, and like I said my experience with the original Airpods was lacking.  Additionally, after playing a few of my favorite songs with each unit, the Airpods Pro 2 sounded good, but the Bose QC II again came out on top. I'm not an audiophile, but the sound was just richer, with more depth; I heard certain notes in a different way than I ever had with the Airpods.  It was at this point that I decided to send the Airpods back, which I did the following day, ready to begin my new and better audio life with the Bose QC II. Everything started out in a state of bliss. Working out of a home office, I could no longer hear my wife working through her accounting problems via Zoom calls in the other room. (FWIW, I also didn't hear her when she came up behind me and asked if I wanted something for lunch). I received a call, and though I fumbled a bit with the controls the first time the call quality was fine, and they seemed to be able to hear me OK.  However, the first chink in the armor came just this evening when I tried connecting the Bose QC II to my Windows system in preparation for a call I have tomorrow. Connection via Bluetooth was simple and straightforward. I then went to a news site that I knew had videos and listened. For some reason the sound kept clicking in and out. I thought it might be the connection with the site, so opened Spotify and played a couple of songs. Same issue. I then went to the Bose app on my iPhone, which said it was having trouble connecting, even though it was in fact connected to the PC (albeit a little glitchy).  At the end of the day, this last experience seems consistent with so many of the other reviews that I read up here (thank you), and I just don't want to be dealing with this again and again (and especially not after I'm past the return window!). I have no interest in going through a tech support call with Bose or them sending a new pair. For $300 plus tax I shouldn't have to, and these should work more seamlessly. So I'm returning, and I'm not sure what I'm going to replace them with.  A few other observations:  - The controls for pausing, skipping forward, moving back, volume control, etc. work and are intuitive, however a few times I inadvertently paused music when I was just trying to adjust the earpod. This wasn't the deal killer; I figured in time I'd get used to the sensitivity and figure it out. But it was a little annoying and perhaps some sensitivity adjustments, or more of a haptic-type feel would work better.  - The earbuds themselves fit great out of the box. I didn't even try the other sizes. They were very comfortable.  - I liked how each time I put the earpods in it told me how much battery was left in each.  - The charging case is slightly larger than the Airpods case, but still very pocketable. I could care less that it doesn't support wireless charging, just not a big deal to me. The magnet holding the earpods in also seemed a little stronger than Apple's case, which I really liked because anytime I accidentally dropped the Apple case the earpods would fall out and slide all over the place (wood floors).  In summary, again I really, really wanted these to work out. I was so impressed with the ANC and sound quality, and liked how the bass and treble could be adjusted in the Bose app. It's just a shame that it had these connection glitches with my computer system. To be clear, I've read that Bose customer support is good and fair, but again if I have to call customer support to just to properly use a pair of $300 earbuds then something is wrong.  UPDATE: So before returning I decided to try one more time with connecting to computer. I shut down all devices (iPad, etc) that were near the computer, to reduce any potential interference. This resolved the issue with the sound breaking out and the earbuds worked fine.  I then shut down the computer and reconnected them to the iPhone. All good. However, when I rebooted the computer I somehow lost the connection with the iPhone, and what I was listening to stopped playing. I then looked at the Bose app and it was somewhere in no man’s land, searching for a connection with the earbuds. Only a reboot of the phone got the app out of this mode, and allowed me to reconnect.  So… this takes me back to my original point: These are among THE MOST EXPENSIVE earbuds on the market right now. I’m the consumer and it’s not my job, nor interest, to troubleshoot problems and jump through hoops to figure out what’s going on. That should have happened at in the Bose QC department, but from my brief experience combined with all the reviews I’ve read, it seems like something slipped past them.  Thank you and God bless.///These headphones are without a doubt the best headphones I have purchased so far in my entire life. I say thus far, because I know that technology is able to continue to become greater and greater as we advance through time, but as of 2023 these headphones are so packed with technology that they meet every need that I could want out of headphones, and additionally have some extra really cool perks.  I want to talk first about the number one need that I wanted these headphones to meet. They claimed that they had 100% noise canceling and I can confirm that that is absolutely correct. Closing out the loud outside world is something that is real true need of mine. I live in a major city, and everything is so loud that I can barely concentrate. I can't go to the grocery store, out to eat, for a walk down the road, or sometimes even sit in my own home without having some sort of overpowering noise that I don't want to hear.  So here's how these headphones work noise canceling-wise. I'll give you two scenarios. Scenario one, I have had a hard day and had to talk to people all day. I'm hungry, tired, don't want to talk to anyone or hear anyone's voices. I go to my favorite fish restaurant because I'm too tired to cook but I know that I'm going to need some peace and quiet when I get there. I place my food order, then sit down at my table in a very noisy environment with lots of peoples conversations going in the background. Relaxation is just about to begin. I take out my Bose headphones, I insert one into my ear, and then immediately I hear this sound that sounds like a lightsaber. That's the Microphones in the headphones testing the ear seal to make sure sound doesn't get into the headphones. I insert the second headphone into my other ear, and hear another lightsaber like sound. For about two more second I can still hear peoples voices and then all of the sudden I hear a "beep" and everyone's voices fade away! The noise cancelling has kicked in, and it's time for me to enjoy my dinner with some relaxing peaceful music. I'm now sitting in the middle of a restaurant and I can only hear my music and no one's voices at all. Sometimes I'll turn my music off in the middle of the restaurant, and I'll watch funny Instagram videos in the headphones. Usually after a 20 minute meal and some funny videos, I'm so relaxed and happy even after a hard day's work, that I'm ready to go home and go to sleep.  Scenario two. I live next to a very busy major street. I can hear lots of road noise, exhaust, loud stereos, and many other kinds of noises. I like to take walks and relax. It's not very relaxing walking when I have to hear a lot of these noises. I insert my bose headphones , and all of the road noises fade away. All I can hear once again is my music. I have to make sure that I stay on the sidewalk when walking, because these headphones cancel out noise so well that if I try to walk on the road, I'll likely get hit by a car because I will not hear the cars driving near me.  So that being said, the main thing I love about these is the noise canceling. I mentioned that there were couple cool extra things about these that I wanted to tell you about. I do like the amount of bass that these headphones are able to produce. It's way more than I expected. Additionally the clarity on these headphones is so good that I can can barely describe it in words. There is a treble mode, and a bass mode within the app so I can choose between these two modes and intensify the kind of clarity and or bass that I'd like.  The charging case is a medium to small size. It fits well then my pants pocket and doesn't get in the way when I'm in the gym. That's one other thing that I wanted to make sure I told you about, is that these are the perfect headphones for the gym. I've seen several other people in the gym with them on, and now I know why. They don't move around in my ears at all! I work out very intensely, and if headphones were going to move around then they would move around on me. They stay exactly where I put them even though I'm sweating on them non-stop for over an hour each day.  I love everything about these headphones. My only regret is that I let the price of these scare me away for so long, and I didn't order them soon enough.///Short review: An upgrade in every way to their previous earbuds. Better noise cancellation, better charging case, at least as good of fit (it feels just as secure as the last ones in my ears). Useable for long periods of time without discomfort (the previous ones would hurt my ear after awhile), I have used these from full to zero twice now without any notable discomfort. The sound is at least on par with the previous version, my brain says it's better but my mind says it's about the same.  Longer review: Noise cancellation has always been good on Bose products, and these buds somehow improve that significantly over the last version. Very subjective benchmark, but I find that with these new buds I have my phone volume set between 3-5 ticks from silent; with the previous version, that was 8-11. That may sound like a lot, but I suspect these buds are a bit louder at the same volume setting than the previous version. I am certain listening volumes are lower though, so this is still an improvement.  Related to the noise cancellation, noise pass-through! My primary use case is in an office environment, where I may need to talk to someone at random times. It is still just as easy to switch from cancelling to pass-through, so no worry there. The sound of my own voice comes through a lot more naturally than with the previous version; helpful for conversations, my own voice always sounded strange coming through the last buds.  Fit and comfort: Here is the biggest improvement in my opinion. They managed to make these comfortable for long use without compromising the fit. YMMV of course, but for my ears they are just as secure as the last buds. I can now wear them from full battery to zero, something I could not do because of the pain that built up if I tried to do so with the old version.  Audio quality: I don't have much to say here other than that these are at least on par with the older version in terms of how good music sounds. Very subjective obviously. It's bluetooth audio, so by no means audiophile standard. Good enough, unless you absolutely must have crystal high-fidelity audio.  Accessories: Pretty standard accessories, you get 3 different sizes of tips and wings to fit your ears. A short USB A to C cable for charging. And, of course, the charging case for the buds. Massive upgrade on that last item if you compare to the previous version. Smooth edges, pocketable shape. Much closer to airpods-style. This might have been a make or break point for a lot of folks so it's good they recognized the need for a more pocketable charging case.  Bluetooth Connectivity/technical issues: Not something I usually even mention, but I feel like I must. First bluetooth connection is super easy, as soon as you open the case for the first time it goes into pairing mode. If you want to pair to more devices, you need to have the lid open or it won't go into pairing mode. Not the end of the world, just a strange choice. I have had some intermittent noise issues, not like white noise but a sort of scratching electronic sound. It disappears the moment you start playing something and isn't usually present when you are not, but it is worth mentioning. I reckon it has to do with the noise cancellation, some kind of feedback loop maybe? I don't know. They elimitated a similar issue I experienced every time I put in the last version, and it has been replaced with a much less intrusive problem. Guess that's an upgrade? lol.  Overall, straight upgrade to the previous version. Whether the price difference is worth it is hard to determine, but if the $50 difference is enough to give pause you might consider going another route (like getting some cheap IEMs and a USB/Bluetooth DAC, you can save $100 and have better audio quality at the same time, without sacrificing much more than active noise cancelling. IEMs block a lot of sound passively, and they sound better. Just saying!). I am happy to have both, but that's a luxury many can't afford. If pure convenience is what you want, go for these; if you have time to kill for the research to save money, look elsewhere.///This is my very first purchase of wireless earbuds (well, I purchased 3 others at same time, to compare them to each other). I did a decent amount of research in a short period of time, and landed on three of the highest rated. These, the Sony WF-1000XM4 and the Beats Fit Pro. I'll start by stating that I haven't felt compelled enough to actually write a review in years. I was so afraid these would disappoint me based on other reviews and Reddit threads, but after just a couple minutes listening to music with these and the Sony earbuds - I had determined an easy winner. I didn't even bother opening the Beats Fit Pro because I knew there was no way they wound better than Bose. My previous earbuds were Bose Soundsport (a gift from someone), so maybe I just have some bias because I'm accustomed to the sound that Bose delivers. My only other prior experience with ANC wireless earbuds is Apple Airpods Pro (I think first generation?) and all I remember when I tried them is instantly thinking the music quality wasn't even close to my Soundsport. Which is a good segue into my Pros and Cons list.  PROS: 1. Sound/Music quality. I'm not educated on all the components of sound/music, I don't know the exact science of what's what, I only know what sounds good to me. I know when music sounds "full bodied" and that's how I'd describe these/the Bose sound. The bass especially. I love Bose bass.  1. Comfort. One of my biggest gripes with the Bose Soundsport was the fit/the wing tips. I HATE the wing tips, even with the smallest size they would cause soreness in my left ear in less than hour. In contrast, I LOVE the way these fit/feel. I have worn them for 3+ hours with zero discomfort. And that's with the size that they came with, I haven't even tried the other sizes yet to see if they can be even more comfortable.  2. Noise Cancelling. Again, I'm not highly educated/experienced in this area (Soundsport didn't have ANC), but I can tell these do it well. I blow-dried my hair while listening to music and I couldn't hear the blowdryer at all (I did have my music up to max/near max volume), but still. I did try to compare this feature with Sony's, and either Sony's ANC was malfunctioning (I researched and troubleshooted), or it was just really bad in comparison to Bose.  3. Easy set-up/sync. Scanned a QR code, downloaded the app, and boom, I was connected. I've had zero connection issues. (I have a Galaxy S21+).  4. Aesthetic. I like how they look. I didn't like the weird knob thingy on the Sony, and I don't like the very obvious "b" Beats logo that's on the Bits Fit Pro, so I am extra grateful that I ended up liking these the most, because I also like how they look the most.  CONS: 1. Hiss/static noise. One of the biggest complaints I saw people have with these is the faint static/hiss noise (when no music/sound is playing), particularly when in Aware mode (ANC turned off). And yes, mine make the noise, and it can be heard even if music is playing at a very low volume, and yes it's annoying, but when I considered how infrequently I would have my earbuds in but not have any music/sound playing (or have volume low enough to hear the static), I determined that's really not a deal breaker for me, and it doesn't outweigh the pros.  2. At first they were a little difficult to remove from the case, but I have quickly gotten better at knowing where to grab/how to remove.  NEUTRAL FOR NOW/WILL UPDATE LATER: 1. Call/mic quality? In my research I also came across a lot of complaints about call quality, people say that the other person on the line can barely hear them/there's a lot of noise, etc. For me, I literally didn't even consider this a factor in my decision making, because I barely care. It's not my primary purpose or use for my wireless earbuds. However, I'll eventually test it out and will update my review later with my experience.  2. Touch controls. I'm new to this, so it could just be a learning curve, but every so often I have trouble getting the touch controls to respond or do exactly what I want. I like it, I think it's neat, and I'm sure I'll get better at it, but I also expect touch controls in general to be finicky on occasion.  CONCLUSION: While I would recommend these to anyone, I do believe the best choice for everyone is going to be different, and that it's important to know what your priorities are, what annoys you more, etc.  For me personally, the primary purpose of my earbuds is for enjoying music for relatively long periods of time, oftentimes while engaging in physical activity/chores, so sound/music quality and comfort are my two greatest priorities, so for my purposes, I am absolutely thrilled with these.///I have never liked earbuds. The main reason: they always fell out of my ears. Even if they had some method -- ear loops, whatever -- of keeping them in my ear, they always loosened enough to compromise the seal and the sound quality would deteriorate. They were just not worth the trouble.  These are the ones that finally worked for me. I played with the combinations of tips and bands until I found the ones that gave me the right combination of fit, seal, stability, and comfort. Now I can walk, move my head around, or jump up and down and the buds stay put, and the sound doesn't change.  Which gives me the opportunity to listen to them. And they sound great. Headphone sound is fairly subjective, but I'm used to some fairly excellent-sounding headphones, and these are quite competitive, with an immediate, engaging sound that's missing nothing and delivers everything with accuracy and clarity. And they sound the same after a few hours of walking, working, doing chores or whatever, without needing to be pushed back in or otherwise readjusted.  And they need to sound good, because the noise canceling is so spookily effective that you can't hear anything else when it's fully active. It's eerie when you insert the second bud and the sound of the world just fades completely away. I've never heard ANC this good -- and my other daily driver is a pair of Bose QC35II, which is no slouch. But the Buds are better.  Other features work well: the touch controls for volume, pause, "Mode" (selecting the degree of ANC as pre-programmed by the user) work well, although I needed some practice at first. The case is fine, the charging works fine, it's all very elegant. Features others complain about missing -- wireless charging, spacial audio -- are just not things I care about. YMMV. I can, however, imagine the daay I would wish for a "find my buds" feature.  But as the first earbuds of any type I've ever been able to truly use and enjoy, they really work for me. That they sound so good and can silence the world to any degree up to "totally" really makes them special.///I purchased these primarily because I’ve owned and have loved everything about my experience with the Bose QC35II Headphones. Also, the reviews about the audio quality from those who have used competing brands and especially from those who have compared the BOSE earbuds to the BOSE headphones made me relatively certain that I would be satisfied with the audio quality of these earbuds.  The connectivity features of the BOSE earbuds however, are lacking. Things that you think should work intuitively, don’t always. For example, the earbuds don’t automatically connect to the last source they were connected to when you put them away, and there is no way to select a different (paired) source using the touch-sensitive controls on the earbuds. Instead, you have to go to your TV or PC or phone’s Bluetooth settings to connect the earbuds, and that isn’t always as reliable as you would expect. I don’t like having to rely on using an app or placing the earbuds in the case to switch sources.  A glaring omission with the app is that while it does provide charge level indications for each earbud, WHY is there NO CHARGE LEVEL INDICATION FOR THE CASE?!?!?! It’s very annoying to place your discharged earbuds in the case for an hour, thinking they will be fully charged, only to remove them from the case and discover that you only have less than a full charge, sometimes far less than a full charge, because the case ran out of power. There is no way of knowing how much charge remains in the case. I hope that BOSE updates the app to add an indicator for case charge level, if the case hardware even supports doing that . . . It may not even be possible, and that would be an even greater disappointment.  All things considered, I am very happy with the BOSE QC Earbuds II. They sound amazing, fit well, deliver best-in-class noise reduction, provide a decent feature set and are, ultimately, worth the high price of admission as long as they provide me with this level of enjoyment for at least as many years as my Bose QC35 II headphones have done.///In short, I love these things. They are more comfortable to wear than the first-gen Bose QC, and the performance is better. The sound quality and noise cancellation are absolutely fantastic and better than the QC I. I had some issues with pairing the QC I buds with devices that could not install the app, but these pair fine, app or not. Range from the source seems slightly better, as well.  The app is pretty good if limited in function. I very much appreciate the ability to select another source in the app (even if I need to connect it to the device I am using first). Occasionally, the app is not able to find the earbuds if I open the app before I take an earbud out of the case, but that's easily fixed. My biggest complaint about functions is that you have only 2 options when it comes to a shortcut (either changing the "mode" or activating the voice assistant--pretty lame--I'd like to see more options there.  The microphone has very good fidelity, but it picks up every single little breeze. That makes it, at least, very irritating when trying to talk to someone on the phone while outside, and it can even be nearly impossible. That really needs to be fixed.  I've yet to run the battery dry, so I cannot comment on battery life. However, it seems to be at least as good as advertised if you can trust it's own assessment of how much charge remains.  But that brings us to the only real, glaring disadvantage over the QC I. The QC II case does not have wireless charging. I don't know what's going on with that or who thought that was a good idea. Every other friggin' "premium" earbuds I've seen in the last five years (or more) have wireless charging. I know it's already a large case, but I think we'd all be fine with one slightly larger enough to accomodate wireless charging.///As of April 2023, these are by far the best ear buds on the planet. I live in my ear buds.. every day, almost all day I have them in watching videos and streams and some music so I always splurge on what the reviews say are the best. I had the Sony XM4s for 13 months and I used them every day until their battery very quickly went from lasting 6 hours to 4 to literally 1 hour. Their warranty is 12 months and at 12 months and 1 day, they won't honor it. Had to throw them away after 13 months. I was extremely impressed with those so I was actually shocked when I first put these QC 2s in my ears... -The noise cancelling is revolutionary. Like, actually a game changer. I have $1200 noise cancelling aviation headsets and they don't come close to these never mind the XM4s. It makes every other noise cancelling I've experienced seem like a gimmick toy by comparison, it's actually a strange sensation is so amazing. -the sound isn't even comparable to anything else. These are night and day way better than the XM4s and every other ear buds I've ever heard. The base actually sounds like a crisp powerful sub woofer with in depth deep powerful notes when listening to explosions or music. It's just a powerful and full sound without any lacking areas. -they are extremely comfortable, so were the XM4s. It's kind of a wash here because I could have both in my ears for 10 hours and be happy and I probably readjust them just as often as any other bud at the gym. -they look cool, better than the girlie XM4s that had that rose gold jewelry look that I had to sand down and paint black. These are masculine and nice right from Bose. On the bigger side but couldn't care less for the noise cancelling and auditory performance. -the app and controls kinda suck, not going to lie. Had some connectivity issues with the app and had to reset the buds for it to connect to them. You need the app to connect to them change any settings.. I find it annoying that you can't turn the controls off or customize any of the touch shortcuts. I had much cheaper buds with completely customizable touch controls and the app would let you turn off all or any singular touch control you don't want for any situation. Bose, epic hardware, just hire one good software guy too. -the only actual problem and complaint I have with these are you can't turn off the noise cancelling or noise enhancing feature entirely. If you are on a motorcycle or in heavy wind, noise cancelling buds give loud feedback and the XM4s allowed you to turn that off but still get audio, these are always on. Again, epic hardware, hire a software guy.  Overall, nothing even comes close to these ear buds regardless of the mediocre software attached to them that you will almost never use after initial setup. That being said, they should solve that issue cause it's not very hard to do and for $300 and the best hardware on the market, a good fully customizable software program to go with them would really seal the deal and complete the package.///My original review for this product was not good. If you are used to connecting with the old Bose QC earbuds, connecting with the II's will really throw you. While there is a button on the side of the new case. It does not do what the old case button did, i.e. rotate through your devices. All it does is get you into pairing mode.  Connectivity is done automatically or by connecting through your device bluetooth settings.  Connecting to my Airfly was the toughest though since it has no bluetooth setting screen, but it does recognize the airfly and pair with it. To do it, open the case with the earbuds inside. Push the button on the side to get the case light to flash blue (discover and pair). Then put the Airfly in pairing mode. Since the earbuds are not in your ears, you wont be able to hear pairing confirmation, but they will pair. Switching back to the airfly can be done by turning the airfly off then on. It will never say "connected to Airfly" for some reason - it just connects.  I miss the button on the old case, but these earbuds are worth the switch. They are smaller, more comfortable and the battery lasts longer.  2 weeks later: Two other slight negatives. The case does not have wireless charging (the old case did), but the smaller case size is an acceptable tradeoff. Also, I realized that the Bose iOS app only seems to recognize iOS products, so although it can connect to my AirFly and my MacBook Pro, the app only offers my iPhone and iPad to switch between. Not a huge issue because I usually use the Bluetooth settings to switch devices which works fine.  Still, all the positives of the Bose QC II's are still there: Great noise cancelling, great sound and great comfort. Plus the Bose do not fall out of my ears when eating which my AirPods often did.///First off, let me be very clear about my negatives: They are extremely picky and will probably not concern many buyers.  Sound quality is outstanding. Noise cancellation is near flawless. Battery life? Not so much. You don't get great sound/great noise cancellation without a price and the cost of these two qualities is roughly 7 hours of battery life.  Still, I can deal with the somewhat limited batter life but something I can't stand is - if you touch the outside of the Buds while they are inserted, they will pause whatever you were listening to and cancel the noise cancelling. This sounds like a bonus to some - and the Bose Ap does allow you to modify what the touching does - but you CANNOT shut that off. I like to fall asleep listening to an audiobook - and i like that these are brilliant for cancelling my constantly fighting neighbors and their horrific kids...but unless i hold my head absolutely perfectly still, one of the Buds will touch my shoulder and CLICK - off goes the book, on comes the sound and it's a shocking difference so that inevitably wakes me every night. I'm starting to doubt if these were a good purchase or not, hence the 3.5 stars.  Great hardware. Really sketchy software. COME ON BOSE! You folks are better than this.@@@202]]]46]]]54]]]133]]]4]]]3]]]7]]]56]]]4]]]0                                                                                                                                                          I bought this stair stepper as an attempt to be more active and consistent. I’m a single mom to a toddler under two and I live with chronic pain every day. As a former weight lifter, this stair stepper exceeds my expectations. - it’s small and compact. Much easier to use versus trying to use a treadmill with a toddler. - you can feel the burn within minutes. - it’s quiet and doesn’t draw attention. - in 30 minutes I can burn almost 200 calories. - I can stand up straight or lean over with my elbows on a countertop if/when my back starts hurting. - despite it being low impact I feel like I’m doing something and burning calories + building muscle.  I’ve tried Pilates, walking and other low impact workouts but I would either be left in pain from my joint issues or feel like it was a waste of time. This little machine leaves me sweating without being in debilitating pain after. I would 100% recommend.///I have only had it a few days, but really like that I can set it up behind my recliner so I can hold on while I get used to it. I am looking forward to using the resistant band. I like that you can set the stepping height. It will be easy to move from room to room, but like that I can easily do a few steps from my living room while I watch tv. Don't let the size fool you, it will give you a work out. Since it's easily accessible my husband and I can benefit from it.///Get your steps in with this mini stepper!! It’s sturdy, easy initial set up and reminds me of the big stairmasters you see at gyms. It tells you how many steps you take and if you are on Weight Watchers, it takes 900 steps to get 1 workout point! First time using this and I only got 400 steps in. This is a workout space saver and sweat machine. The resistance bands are a great addition and you work everything because you have to balance and use your core muscles. Well worth it!///I can’t go out on my long walks like I used to with my little one so I thought I’d give this stepper a try. It was definitely worth the money. I can take it into any room and I get a nice sweat from it. If you want to get your cardio done in the house this is a good buy.///Have gained a few pounds and needed to make time to go walking or something and I saw this stepper and it has helped me to work some muscles I had not for a time as I felt the pain of it, so it is working. If I am consistent then I will see the effects of it.///I’m loving the convenience of the set up and get right to exercising. I work and workout. I appreciate the opportunity to work both upper and lower body with resistance bands.///This is my first stepper so I followed the instructions to the letter but when I stepped on the peddles they wouldn't go up and down. I posted a question and got the answer. You have to turn the tension up all the way (which I did at first per the manual). So I did that again. Then turned it all the way down and then back up again and it worked! Then I adjusted it down to a level that was good for me. It only comes with the straps and no balance bar so if your balance is off, as is mine, I simply moved it over to my exercise bike and used the handlebar as support. It's a nice and compact and easy to use. That the tiny screen is very mall and you have to get right down eye to eye with it to read it, so if you're counting steps you have to keep track yourself and then get down on the floor to see the count.///This has been perfect so far. I don't have room for big pieces of exercise equipment in my house so this is exactly what I needed.///Love it. Easy to set up and does not take up space. I can feel the burn when using it definitely gives a work out.///I purchased this item to use at my desk at work. It works well for the desk that I have. It is much better quality than I expected and was easy to pull out of the box and get going! Recommended it to my coworkers and they loved it too!@@@15]]]34]]]39]]]7]]]4]]]0]]]136]]]2]]]0]]]27                                                                                                                                             Bought the size 9-12mo for my 19mo old toddler who is 22lbs and 31” tall. He currently wears size 12mos clothing (size 18mo pajamas) in cat n Jack and carters brands. These shorts fit similar to Carters size 12mos shorts. They are a little loose in the waist on him and a tad long, slightly past the knee, so probably the size 6-9 would fit better, but they aren’t so loose that they fall off and hopefully he will grow into them better this summer.  The material is different than I expected (I just expected a mesh jersey material) instead they are the shiny/slippery true basketball shorts type material. Material doesn’t matter to me but just thought I’d point that out. All in all they seem like good shorts for a great price!///Great quality, fits my 16 month old (who normally wears 18 month clothes) great- they are a little long, but rolling the waist band up once makes them perfect. I love that he has lots of room to grow with them and will be wearing them for a long time. The colors are bright and vibrant and silky soft. I am very pleased///Made well. Run a little big.///Perfect shorts for active kids. I purchased these for my son’s next school year for PE class. They are lightweight, breathable and long enough (above the knee). I will buy a few more///I Love these Shorts! I buy the packs for my son!///Great for flag football this season!///Pleased with the material, and quality of drawstring. Kind of thin material, in a good way. Gym shorts, and size M fits both 9 y.o. aswell as 11 y.o. so they have range. Pleased with this purchase will be buying more///Love the quality! I bought these in a small for my 5.5 year old who wears size 5. I thought 5/6 was a safe bet but they're large enough to fit his 8 year old brother! I'll probably just buy a smaller pair since they're so nice, but I don't know whether to size down one size or two ....///Purchased these bad boys for my son who started soccer season. Since he grows like a weed, I don't like investing in expensive workout gear, and he had no complaints.///I ordered these shorts for my son, and ordered this appropriate size for him based on the sizing guide. These shorts were huge!!!! Good quality but two sizes too big. Definitely size down!@@@0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           OK - so - I have travelled all over the world in my lifetime. Most other countries use Bidets. Funny thing is, whenever I would encounter a bidet; I would sorta laff and use toilet paper as always. In the last 15 years, I have had a lot of surgeries on my back. As I've got older and now into my 60's, wiping my tush had become an "Olympic Event". It's very hard for me to "twist", so it had necessitated 4-6 "Wipe Scoops" after a PooPoo. It got worse and worse, and I was really debating getting some sort of handle or grabber to hold the paper for me while wiping. I already have one for the shower to help me clean, but when wiping a PooPoo, I was sort of "on my own". It was getting very difficult. Among other things, I am an avid fan of South Park. One of their latest episodes was about Japanese Toilets and how much Toilet Paper Americans use. I had no idea the average American uses 140 rolls a year, and it takes over 30 million trees annually to produce all of America's toilet paper. Now, I am not some Psycho environmentalist, but heck, I don't wanna kill trees either. The real message I was getting from that episode was twofold: 1. Paper Companies don't want us installing bidets and 2. Bidets are pretty dang awesome. So, that was it. I wanted to try one - for real. After doing my research, I settled on this NEO 185 unit from Luxe. I love it. I also ordered the Luxe toilet seat, as I figured the fit would be not an issue. Installing this unit along with the Luxe toilet seat took me around 15 minutes. My first "Test Drive" was fascinating. Now, a few tips: Tip 1. - This unit is not heated - if you can't bear the thought of cold water - don't get it - I tell you, the cold water feels wonderful to me, but be advised, it will be the temperature that comes from your taps. Tip 2. - Many reviewers talk about bad supplies with the kit etc. - I say HOGWASH and POPPYCOCK. The hardware provided is top-quality, and in fact, I am not a fan of "Over-Tightening" things that have good rubber gaskets as these fittings have - I only did everything "HAND-TIGHT" and then an extra 1/4 turn, and the system is NOT leaking anywhere and works perfectly. Tip 3, - Getting used to using the system. My experience is such that if you just sit still in one spot and blast your tushy a bit, you will not get all the PooPoo. Without being gross here, you will find that moving your tush forward and backward a little bit here and there, flexing Mr. Brown Eye a bit, and opening your cheeks a little will work and get your butt squeaky clean. Once I found out the "trick" to my tushy and this system, I am CLEAN as a WHISTLE once I'm done using it. Tip 4. - Drying - This system doesn't have a drying mechanism either - so - you either use toilet paper and get a hand of wet, papery mush, OR you use a towel etc. and wash them in the washing machine after a few uses, OR - you do what I am doing. I am using the ONLY wipe that is rated SAFE for American septic systems - the Cottenelle Flushable Wipes. Do your research, and you will find out that ALL other wipes, baby wipes, etc. may SAY flushable - but really are not. So, after I am done cleaning my tushy, I use one Cottenelle Flushable Wipe - and it puts that final "Spit Shine" on it.  GET THIS THING - INSTALL IT CORRECTLY ACCORDING TO DIRECTIONS - AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE - I DID///I never posted a review when I bought this. I honestly had no idea how I'd like it. Especially when it really wasn't that expensive against other products. People warned me that I wouldn't like cold water spraying me in the winter and that cheap ones don't work well. I really never believe 5 start ratings. Especially when people say they just purchased the item. Here's the real truth. The physical installation was simple. I wasn't crazy about my old toilet seat so also ordered the matching toilet seat. I like the soft closing feature on the new toilet seat. The bidet does a great job and the water pressure is fully adjustable. I use to use a lot of toilet paper and now I don't. I've tried to get my wife to use the female position. I'm not sure if she actually ever tried it but said she doesn't want to use it, nor does she like the plastic toilet seat. I bought one for her toilet as well and she doesn't want it. I never installed or returned it. For the install you have to close the water valve under the toilet. Well, mine wouldn't completely shut off. The old valve would still let some water through. I decided it was time to also change the valve. It was soldered on the pipe so I had to go buy a pipe cutter. To do this I had to turn off the water main for the house. That was also not turning off 100% and I decided I wasn't going to break that fitting to replace the main valve. I was going to turn my water off at the street so I began to go on a wild goose chase to find the right pole to turn off that special valve. I was told I needed a special pole that isn't sold at box stores. I ran around to multiple plumbing supply houses until I found one. It wasn't cheap. I later (after all this was done) saw it at Home Depot for 1/3 what I paid. So now I have purchased all these tools and a new shut off valve for my toilet. I shut off all the water to the house from the street and cut off the valve. I don't have enough pipe left sticking out the wall to put the new valve on. I know how to properly do it because years ago I had borrowed a neighbors pipe cutter, was able to turn off the house water, and easily replace her toilet valve. Now I need to keep the house water off and find a plumber. I don't know how to solder a fitting on a pipe. I had to hire a plumber who can come ASAP and pay for a different valve that is the kind you solder on. In the end I had spent several $100. I still recommend this Bidet. If your toilet valve turns off the water the installation was very easy to do in about 30 minutes. I also like it's matching toilet seat. Depending in the location of your toilet seats feet you may not be able to close the seat over the bidet. I wasn't crazy over my seat so just went ahead and ordered theirs. Like I said earlier, I like the plastic as it's easier to keep clean then the old wood one. I really like the soft self close. I've accidentally let other toilet seats slam because I'm now use to mine.///The LUXE Bidet NEO 185 is a high-quality, non-electric bidet toilet attachment that is designed to provide users with a clean, hygienic and refreshing bathroom experience.

It offers easy installation, convenient and customizable features, and a modern and stylish design. Highly recommended!///THE OLD: Kohler Puretide  I had a Kohler Puretide bidet seat in my condo bathroom for a couple of years. It worked OK, but it eventually lost water pressure. I tried flushing out the supply line, replacing the inlet filter screen and changing out the spray nozzle tip. But nothing really helped. I replaced it with a second Kohler unit and now 2 years later, I'm running into the same low pressure problem. I think the internals just get clogged with mineral buildup.  Also, connecting the supply line to the Kohler inlet was tricky. The female metal nut was difficult to get started onto the plastic male fitting and was very prone to cross threading the plastic. Unfortunately I had to unscrew this fitting every time I wanted to check the inlet screen filter for sediment... something I need to do occasionally after plumbers have been working on the pipes elsewhere in my high rise building.  THE NEW: Luxe NEO 185  So I decided to try something new. I looked at several but decided on the Luxe NEO 185 bidet attachment because it had over 39,000 reviews. I also ordered a Luxe elongated toilet seat.  Installation was a bit confusing at first glance, but I watched a YouTube video on the Luxe website. At one point I though I had a defective plastic nut because it kept slipping as I tried to tighten the mounting screw. But I realized I forgot to include the white plastic socket fitting on the underside of the porcelain mounting hole. The split plastic conical nut needs to nest into that socket fitting in order to properly tighten-up around the mounting screw.  One nice advantage of this new unit is that the inlet screen is placed in the larger end of the supply line where it connects to the metal "T" fitting. So checking that screen for sediment buildup will be much easier task.  In use, the water pressure is now much higher. So high in fact that I chose to reduce the pressure going to the bidet from the "T" fitting. I already had a "T" fitting with it's own quarter-turn valve so I could shut off the supply to the bidet without shutting off supply to the toilet. So I adjusted that "T" valve to reduce overall pressure to the bidet.///Pros: I am disabled so this helps a lot. For me it cleans 99%. Even without a heated water setting, its not too harsh and we got used to it very quickly. My husband installed it in under 15 minutes including cleaning the toilet (yay). It doesnt elevate our toilet seat which is oval shaped.  Eh: The regular setting doesnt quite hit the right spot so we keep it on the feminine setting which hits perfectly, but that means you dont get front female cleaning (being overweight-not sure if its different for others) and still have to use toilet paper. I would love an attachment that wrapped around the toilet bowl and sprayed my front.  Cons: TMI warning: My husband gets fatty/oily poops and it doesnt clean that off at all even on the highest pressure. Water/grease? Dont mix.  Reminder to potential buyers: Either you still use some toilet paper to clean water/pee or you will need to make washable pads to dry off with. And if they arent being used and you dont have toilet paper- you know someone is pulling pants up with a wet bum.///I have arthritis in the facet joints of my spine & it doesn't move like it did when I was young. This works perfectly & I should have bought it when I first thought of it & when I knew I needed it. It takes me longer to do things these days. Especially when they are closer to the ground. I was still able enough to install this in less than one hour. It took a couple tries to get trajectory just right & I never had to adjust it since. I do wish it came with an inline shut-off valve so my young grandkids wouldn't have a chance to play as many do. I did see after I had already installed it that Amazon has a shut-off valve at a reasonable price that'll work. But I ended up not getting it because I didn't want to have to work on it unless I really had to & by then the grandkids were over their need to explore further. I waited quite a while before putting in a review because I wanted to see if any problems arise. I haven't had any problems with the bidet from day one.///Not sure why this isn't a more prevalent item in houses but it is a great thing to use. Once you've tried it it's hard when there isn't one to use. These have been around for centuries but haven't made their way into our society. During the pandemic this was a great thing to have due to all the paper shortages and not that things are almost normal again it's a great money saver. I don't need to buy as much toilet paper as I used to and it really doesn't use a significant amount of water to clean your butt! It is definitely worth the price to get this and hook it up. Mine is a cold water only but it really doesn't feel all that cold even in the winter since the water coming to it is warmed a bit in the pipes due to your warm house. They do make models with a hot was side to make the water warmer, just like sink or shower.///First things first, you have to use toilet paper with your bidet. Common mistake is that people just rinse the buthole without wiping. No, you rinse them wipe, but the pro about having a bidet is that you use 60-70% less toilet paper than you would a normal wipe.  Now, I’ve used a fancy Japanese bidet before but that was when I traveled to Japan. A device like that where you might not need to wipe at all can range between $200-$4000. The world of bidets are cheap if you want the full luxuries of having a warm, clean and dry buttock.  This is great to have at home if you just want to dip your toes into trying out a bidet. Honestly, I don’t know why i didn’t get it sooner, ive saved on toilet paper, and my buthole has never been cleaner after a long sit on the toilet.  If you want a bidet, but don’t want to spend the big bucks this is your best bet. In the summer it’s great, the winter may be a little rougher as it does not have the hot water function. All in all though, for the price and quick and easy install, 5 stars///The media could not be loaded. The lengthy part of this review is about installation, this paragraph is the actual review for the Neo185, in a rental apartment. This thing is great! I don't have any complaints, but I do have some hilarious tips for anyone who has never taken apart a toilet before. I wanted to give this a try out of curiosity and knowing about the benefits. Personally, the water still remains cold even after sitting in the hose. Yes, the double features mean you have to learn how to adjust your body so it hits correctly. It doesn't need the amount of settings it has, the lowest one alone is very powerful. Getting used to patting dry takes some time. This does not fully eliminate the need for toilet paper, but it does greatly reduce the amount used. I'm debating getting the "butt towels" to cut down even more. Also, just get the seat bumpers. You won't regret it, and even if you do you're only out like $8-$15. It's worth it to not be worried about accidentally breaking your toilet seat and having to pay for replacing it. They have plenty more uses if you don't need them for the toilet.  Installation instructions/tips below (along with my silly fopa lol): If you want to register it and extend your warranty, do it BEFORE installing. Firstly, clean your toilet and surrounding area before starting. If you rent an apartment, it's more than likely you haven't considered the toilet seat bolts before and they will probably be gross. Do this before beginning or before removing anything. This, I did. I'm very thankful for that because being that close to the toilet isn't exactly enthralling (especially if you make lots of little mistakes and need to get real upclose).  Secondly, gather all of your supplies and whatnot and place them near you before starting. This, I did not do, resulting in getting up a million times and making this much more exhausting and time consuming than it should have been.  Steps: Turn off your toilets water supply, drain the tank. Check the tank is drained. Place a towel underneath, on the floor. Disconnect your water supply line, and allow it to drip for a little while (I didn't wait and got much more water on myself than necessary). If you don't have good plumbers (teflon) tape, be a perfectionist and align the included very carefully, wrap 2-3 times only. It sucks, but it'll work if you're patient. I don't know what the purpose of the included wrenches are, honestly. All bolts have a wing nut attached that you can use to tighten, so the wrenches weren't needed. Get your T adapter and the water supply hoses all hooked up, THEN remove your toilet seat cover.  Now, I'd never had the pleasure of removing a toilet seat cover before. So, for those of you in the same boat, this section is for you. I find these mistakes hilarious, but it was a great way to learn. First of all, rental apartment toilet seats have bolt covers and if you didn't know this, they're probably still gross even after cleaning (especially inside, yuck) and might be difficult to pry open. Secondly, the bolts holding your toilet seat in place go THROUGH the back of the toilet bowl. I'm still laughing at how much time I wasted trying to simply unscrew them, I guess I thought they screwed into the bowl itself? I thought they had stripped and got stuck, was trying to figure that out, and discovered the truth. These screws have nuts on the underside of your toilet bowl (see image), imagine that! I did require an adjustable wrench to get those loose, and they did need a nice soak in some cleaner because they were real gross. Now, I know an additional area of the toilet to clean, which I had never considered, and maybe you do too!  Final steps: Cross your toilet seat like a T on the end of the bowl, balanced. Place the attachment down, add the round things, rotate your toilet seat back around and use it to weigh down the attachment (gently!), then adjust as necessary so you're able to get your screws back in place. Put the nuts back, tighten enough to hold in place but resist the urge to tighten further. You will crack the plastic, I narrowly avoided this and I'm grateful I did. Connect the hose to the bidet. Gently tighten. Turn water back on. Keep the toilet seat closed and test out the bidet. You will hear it hit the seat if it's done correctly.///My brown eye is so grateful for this bidet, despite a challenging introduction. The initial installation had all of the makings of a simple and breezy process; however, the screws that hold my toilet lid in place are nearly the *exact* width of the holes in the attachment, and their placement in such near proximity to the bowl as to make for lengthy and arduous proceedings. After a half hour of sweating and cursing, I finally managed to wrangle it into position, tightly fitted against the back rim of the bowl with no gaps, the seat sturdily in place with no wobbling to be felt. Compared to getting the unit on the seat, attaching the plumbing components was child’s play, the work of mere moments. Finally, the moment of truth…does it work? Have I succeeded in achieving my dreams of a squeaky-clean poop chute? I knelt in front of the toilet and turned the water back on to its normal pressure. With bated breath, I tremulously turned the knob to the lowest setting, expecting a slight trickle. Instead, I was greeted with an icy blast straight to the face, the force of which rivaled Old Faithful herself. I quickly turned it back off. My shirt? Soaked. My hair? Plastered to my head. The freshly-Windexed bathroom mirror a few feet behind me? Splattered with water droplets. The ceiling? Dripping. It worked, alright. I have since adjusted the water pressure to the toilet to help avoid blasting my stinky starfish halfway to Saturn. It now takes my tank approximately 7.5 years to refill after every flush, but that’s a small price to pay for a hygienic Hershey highway. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to getting a fresh enema from Jack Frost every morning, but my chocolate factory has never been more sparkling. 9/10 rusty balloon knots.@@@82]]]31]]]3]]]2]]]3]]]2]]]0]]]3]]]102]]]25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Very nice for the money. I think it's more visually pleasing than others I've looked at and also mounts in a slightly better position.  Works good for me but don't know if it's good for a woman until my wife comes home and I convince her to go for a ride. Lol  It hit a bullseye for me, but when I tested both settings it hits in the same place, but the feminine setting simply fans out to a spray rather than a steam like the posterior setting. There didn't seem to be a difference from forward to aft.  The button arrangement is very straight forward, and the separate flow dial is really nice. Just set it and forget it. All to do is push a button from that point on, unlike others where you have to dial it in each and every time.  I think the savings in toilet paper will pay for this bidet in a month or less.  Think of the trees that will be saved by not having to cut one down every time you wipe! Now if they only made receipts at the store shorter in length... All the forests of the world would be saved!  Don't be a baby. Cold water isn't so bad. My butt feels better than I can ever remember.  A side note on connection. I recommend buying an appropriate braided flexible toilet supply line if you don't already have one. They're only $6.00 and will make installation a breeze. A big plus of buying a new one is the fact that you'll have nice new seals. Make sure you install the seal correctly that comes with the bidet in the T fitting. Tapered to the upward position as if it would fit into an upside down V. Smaller side toward the toilet tank.  Also, other reviewers mentioned leaks. They obviously did something wrong, because I'm totally leak free.  No thread tape needed, though included. Don't know why.  Just make sure you don't cross thread the fittings, and only snug them about 1/8-1/4 turn after finger tight. That's all it takes. Don't tighten it like a gorilla on a rampage! It's plumbing, not the lug nuts on a Mack truck! If you over tighten, it will leak!  Definitely recommend this! I'll eventually put them on two or three more toilets in our home.///This is a very affordable way to obtain bidet functionality. The Piket product arrived quickly, installed easily and works well. It was a nice addition that there was Teflon tape included with purchase. You will need a small amount of mechanical ability (or some patience) to install this device but it is not overly difficult. You will need a pair of pliers. You must have a way to shut the water fully off to your toilet, either right below your toilet tank or worst case, the main water supply in your housing unit. Don't forget, after you turn off the water to the toilet to flush it so that you empty the water out of the tank before you disconnect the water supply. A dedicated fixture bidet with a direct vertical water spray head will apply more water pressure and clean you better but those types of units will set you back $1,000-$2,000 and lots more work. I like this unit well enough that I intend to purchase another for our other bathroom.///I had been skeptical of how useful a bidet would be, but installed it by request of my wife. I had no idea how much better a bidet would be. Use of toilet paper has dropped significantly, rarely use wet-wipes anymore, cleaner bottoms, and an altogether great result. Easy to install, took only a couple of minutes, stays very clean, and easy to scrub/wipe down when cleaning the bathroom.///I have used another brand Bidet for about 4 years. Replaced it with "PIKETS Bidet Attachment for Toilet, Dual Nozzle". I like it A LOT. Very nice to set & forget the pressure setting. Push-button operation is very easy. My previous model had an on-off knob where the pressure was adjusted each time used. Also.. I think PIKETS is the same as a higher priced "looks the same" unit. Great price. Great operation. Also, very easy to push the "clean" button after each use. Very happy with this purchase.///One of my best purchases. Works as described. Super easy to install. We used to have the ms bidet. It’s a hose that hangs on side of tank. Water always drips on the floor. Not with this. Use the plumbers tape and no leaks anywhere.///My sister in law convinced me to get an attachment and I amso glad I got this one as my first. Super easy to use, install, and the sprayer has a pretty good range of settings. I love this thing!///So just to be honest, me and my son were watching a movie and I bought this for him. He’s 13 as a gag gift for Christmas. And I had honestly always wondered what it would be like to use a bidet as I have never. So I just installed it last night. I have to say installation was a cakewalk, all of the equipment needed. It has a T that I have pictured that connected to the bottom of the bowl it had Teflon tape included. I did give clear instructions although I did not even use the instructions. It was so simple I just put it right together by Teflon tape all of the joints, snug them up by hand, I did not even have to use a wrench . Everything was very self-explanatory. The only thing that I would say could be improved is the look of there are two snaps valance that hold the unit in place. I don’t know how to describe them other than they are 2 inch discs. OK and I know that it’s made to universally fit in the toilet so they have to make them so big , I just wish I wouldn’t be able to see them quite so much there’s a good 3/4 of an inch hanging off the sides. But that’s me as a incredibly OCD person looking at that and I don’t think that they could actually change the design without making it specific to each toilet, which would not be worth it to them. So I adjusted everything exactly as needed. I had it completely installed within five minutes of starting no issues no leaks. The buttons are pretty self-explanatory , there’s a big booty button and then a female button and then the other button which I couldn’t figure out at first I thought it was broken but that is a self cleaning button and it shoots water down on there. There’s two different shafts that shoot water at two different angles, one for the buuddy and one for the female part. And then there’s a third button that actually shoots water down those two shafts I guess just to clean off any residual splash back from the cleaning process which I find to be an incredibly nice hygienic feature so I don’t have to reach my hand inside the toilet to clean it off. Works like a charm and hit the buttons work good the variable speed knob, adjust the amount of spray that you get which is all I mean it’s just really nice for the money, so I’ll give this five stars all the way.///My chocolate starfish has never been happier. It only makes sense to have a bidet. Only downfall (which is not really a downfall) is that the water isn’t warm (obviously) but still the greatest thing ever///Ante la pregunta si me gusto la respuesta es Si. Ante la pregunta que para que lo use, si es una ducha intima se sobre entiende.///Works great, just as advertised. Why anyone is still using bogroll is a mystery to me. I don’t understand why TP was ever the method of poo patrol, nor why I waited so long to switch. Not sure how well it would work for kids; I’m sure there’s a learning curve there, but it’s better than how poorly they use paper, but you’ll probably have a few toilet fountains until they get the hang of it.@@@3]]]2]]]0]]]2]]]0]]]0]]]35]]]0]]]0]]]0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               جميل جدا اصلي احسن من اللي في المولات كتير///ممتاز///👍///ممتاز لكن أرجو الاهتمام بتغليف المنتج لأنه تسرب لباقي المنتجات///اصلي و سعر ممتاز كالعادة " رابع مره اخذه من امازون "///جيد جدا لكن جودته تغيرت عن اول كثير///اصلي 👍🏻///الافضل على مدى السنين///Normal fairy dish washing liquid///سعر جدا منافس@@@0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0]]]0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I like this mascara better than other brands I've used. I usually buy Loreal; Revlon; and Ulta. Have used Maybelline, Estee Lauder over time as well. What stands out is the ease in applying, separating each lash & seems to take less product for the desired look. You don't have to re-dip the brush. Good job///This mascara beats all other mascaras I’ve used over 50 years. It’s even better than Lancôme. Easy to apply and looks great! Not waterproof but comes off easily!///Leaving three stars. Lengthens lashes beautifully but how the mascara comes off the lower lashes and leaves raccoon eyes is upsetting  I always normally leave great feedback but for the cost of this mascara to leave mascara on bottom of the lower lashes is disappointing  Wished it was water proof because if you even sweat a little. There it goes. Smearing onto the under eyes.///This mascara extends lashes without a lot of fibers however , I have tried to clean my lashes at night thoroughly with 2 different solutions and have still had mascara on lashes which has left marks on towels and border of sheets that can’t be removed even with oxyclean. Therefore I won’t buy it again///Thought this mascara was a little pricey, but it is so easy to apply! Doesn’t clump, separates lashes well, and is very easy to remove///It didn't quite give the volume or length I hoped for and didn't wear super well in the sense of perky eyelashes all day. But a strong option.///I have only been using for a few days, but so far I am pleased with this product. Not sure though it is worth anymore than the Clinique mascaras I’ve used for years. Time will tell. It was easy to obtain it on Amazon.///I am over 50 and have thin eyelashes. This mascara did a wonderful job of adding width as well as length to my lashes. Unfortunately is also runs quite easily. A bit of moisture in the air and I had racoon eyes. Can't trust it. Had to let it go.///I liked this mascara, but my eyes do water sometimes and it comes off too easy. It has a great brush, and not clumpy///This is a pretty good mascara all in all. It goes on without clumping and is easy to remove at the end of the day. My only problem with it, is if my eyes water (I live in a very dry climate) the mascara come off under my eyes. As for improving lash quantity, I don't see an improvement. I would buy this mascara again.@@@10]]]4]]]9]]]9]]]3]]]5]]]5]]]3]]]4]]]13                                                                                                                                                              wow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             wow///wowoww                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    first comment.///second comment///yes love this product!@@@1]]]4]]]66
